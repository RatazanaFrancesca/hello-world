For CS50
Oi, mundo!

My name is Polly and I am from Brazil. I am a marketing professional living in Houston, TX and I am taking CS50 because I think it's really important to know how to code these days - and when it comes to technology I am like a chimpanzee trying to learn sign language. I like biking, yoga, craft beer, flamenco, cats, or anything with cheese, and I am convinced that the right herbal tea can cure almost anything in this life!
